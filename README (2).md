# Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling

# Internship
AI & ML Internship – Task 4

# Dataset
Adult Income Dataset

# Objective
To preprocess the Adult Income Dataset by applying:
- Feature encoding techniques
- Feature scaling
So that the dataset becomes suitable for machine learning models.

# Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

# Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Adult Income Dataset.
2. Identified categorical and numerical features.
3. Applied **Label Encoding** to the target variable (income).
4. Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to unordered categorical features.
5. Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**.
6. Compared data before and after scaling.
7. Saved the final preprocessed dataset.

# Files in This Repository
- `adult_processed.csv` – Preprocessed dataset
- `Feature_Encoding_and_Scaling.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook
- `README.md` – Task documentation

# Outcome
The dataset is now clean, encoded, scaled, and ready for use in machine learning algorithms.

# Key Learnings
- Difference between Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Importance of feature scaling
- Role of feature engineering in ML
